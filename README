CDB::TinyCDB::Wrapper

The non-updateable nature of the .cdb files makes them a litle more
interesting to handle than most DB files---but their extreme speed
makes them very attractive in high-volume situations.

This wrapper classis intended to make the updating of files created
with CDB::TinyCDB a little more transparent.  It was written to ease
use of CDB::TinyCDB files as a Bayes storage layer for SpamAssassin,
and no doubt shows idiosyncracies that reflect that.
